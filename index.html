                    "Boseman was a virtuoso actor who had the rare ability to create a character from the outside in and the inside out and he knew how to fuse with a role, etching it in three dimensions. That's what made him an artist, and a movie star, too. Yet in <b>Black Panther</b>,he
                    also became that rare thing, a culture hero."
